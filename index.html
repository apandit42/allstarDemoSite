          Bugs Bunny debuted in 1940 in <em>A Wild Hare</em>.
        </h2>
        <h4>
          The beloved Looney Tunes and Warner Bros cartoon character has a long history.
          Warner Bros first introduced the prototype concept of a rabbit cartoon character
          in 1938, in the movie <em>Porky's Hare Hunt</em>, directed by Ben "Bugs" Hardaway
          and Cal Dalton, who did the original character design. Voiced by Mel Blanc, the character
          was popular enough to continue being developed, debuting in <em>A Wild Hare</em> to wild
          success and receiving an Academy Award nomination. <em>A Wild Hare</em> also features the
          first time that Bugs Bunny uses his iconic catchphrase "What's up, Doc?". At this point,
          Bugs Bunny had undergone several redesigns by Charlie Thorson and Bob Givens, and Mel Blanc had created
          the iconic voice and Bronx/Brooklyn accent Bugs would become known for. Bugs Bunny's smartaleck wit, easygoing
          nature, and penchant for breaking the 4th wall made him a quick crowd favorite.
        </h4>
        <h2>
          Bugs Bunny would become one of Warner Bros most popular characters, a cartoon icon.
        </h2>
        <h4>
          Fueled by raving audience responses, Warner Bros would continue to create new Bugs Bunny movies and shorts.
          During World War II,  Bugs Bunny became the star of the Warner Bros <em>Merrie Melodies</em> shorts, with
          his popularity skyrocketing due to his easygoing attitude. He would star in several wartime anti-Axis cartoons
          along with his contemporaries, even earning the title of honorary Marine master sergeant for his roles.
          He would star in hundreds of theatrical shorts and most of Warner Bros cartoon productions.
          Following the war, audiences continued to flock to Bugs Bunny cartoons, and eventually Bugs Bunny
          would make his television debut on ABC with <em>The Bugs Bunny Show</em>. Some variant of this
          show would remain on air for over 40 years. In the 1990s, Bugs Bunny starred in <em>Space Jam</em>, a live action
          cartoon mashup that became a cult classic and smash hit success in the Box Office, continuing to show his
          appeal with audiences. Today a sequel blockbuster is in the works, and various spin-offs, reruns, and new TV properties
          continue to feature him and other Looney Tunes favorites.
